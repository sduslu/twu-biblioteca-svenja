1. Who checked out the book 'The Hobbit'?
A: Anand Beck
Query:
SELECT name
FROM member, book, checkout_item WHERE
member.id = checkout_item.member_id
AND checkout_item.book_id = book.id
AND book.title = 'The Hobbit';

2. How many people have not checked out anything?
A: 37
Query:
SELECT COUNT(name)
FROM member
WHERE member.id NOT IN (
 SELECT member.id
 FROM checkout_item, member
 WHERE checkout_item.member_id = member.id
);

3. What books and movies aren't checked out?
A:Fellowship of the Ring
1984
Tom Sawyer
Catcher in the Rye
To Kill a Mockingbird
Domain Driven Design
Thin Red Line
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
Lawrence of Arabia
Office Space

Query:
SELECT book.title FROM book
WHERE book.title NOT IN (
SELECT title FROM book, checkout_item
WHERE book.id = checkout_item.book_id
);
SELECT movie.title FROM movie
WHERE movie.title NOT IN (
SELECT title FROM movie, checkout_item
WHERE movie.id = checkout_item.movie_id
);

4. Add the book 'The pragmatic programmer', and add yourself as a member. Check out the said book. Use your query from question 1 to verify that you have checked it out. Also, provide the SQL used to update the database.
A:
Query:
INSERT INTO book (id, title) VALUES (11, "The Pragmatic Programmer");
INSERT INTO member (id, name) VALUES (43, "Svenja Uslu");
INSERT INTO checkout_item (member_id, book_id) VALUES (43, 11);

5. Who has checked out more than 1 item? Tip: Research the GROUP BY syntax.
A: I have not found the answer. My current approach looks as follows:
Query:
SELECT COUNT(checkout_item.book_id), COUNT(checkout_item.movie_id), checkout_item.member_id, member.name FROM checkout_item, member
WHERE member.id = checkout_item.member_id
GROUP BY checkout_item.member_id
;
